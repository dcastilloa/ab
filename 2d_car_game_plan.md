# Barebones Plan for a 2D Car Game

## 1. Core Concept
- Top-down 2D arcade racer.
- Single player; race against a timer or AI ghosts.
- Simple controls: accelerate, brake/reverse, steer left/right.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Engine/Framework**: HTML5 Canvas with JavaScript (e.g. using plain Canvas API or a lightweight library like PixiJS) OR Unity2D / Godot if preferred.
- **Art & Assets**: Placeholder sprites (car, track, obstacles) created in a free tool (e.g. Aseprite, GIMP) or sourced from open-license assets.
- **Audio**: Minimal engine sound loop, collision SFX, simple background track.

## 3. Project Setup
1. Initialize version control repository (Git).
2. Create basic project structure:
   - `index.html` / `main.py` / `Main.tscn` depending on tech stack.
   - `src/` for code, `assets/` for art & audio.
3. Configure build/run script or IDE scene for quick iteration.

## 4. Game Loop Skeleton
```
initialize();
while (gameRunning) {
    handleInput();
    update(deltaTime);
    render();
}
```

## 5. Player Car Prototype
- Position, velocity, angle.
- Acceleration and friction constants.
- Steering adjusts angle; forward vector updates position.
- Draw placeholder sprite rotated to car angle.

## 6. Track & World
- Static background image (track) with collision mask (binary grid or polygon outlines).
- Define start line and lap checkpoints.

## 7. Collision Detection
- Axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) for car vs. track boundaries/obstacles.
- Simple response: stop movement and apply small reverse impulse.

## 8. Camera (optional)
- If track larger than viewport, implement camera following car with clamp to world bounds.

## 9. UI & Feedback
- HUD: timer, lap count, speedometer (numeric).
- Start countdown and finish banner.

## 10. Game States
- Title → Countdown → Racing → Results → Restart.

## 11. Simple AI Ghost (stretch goal)
- Record best lap positions.
- Replay path as translucent "ghost" car.

## 12. Polish Pass
- Replace placeholders with final sprites.
- Particle effects: dust skid, tire marks.
- Sound mix & music loop.

## 13. Packaging & Deployment
- Web build: host on itch.io / GitHub Pages.
- Desktop build: package as executable if using engine.

## 14. Next Steps / Enhancements
- Multiplayer (split-screen or network).
- Power-ups, multiple cars, drifting mechanics.
