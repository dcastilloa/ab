## Fun Animal Fact 🐾

Did you know? Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood! Two hearts pump blood to their gills, while the third pumps blood to the rest of their body. Their blue blood comes from a copper-based protein called hemocyanin, which is more efficient than our iron-based hemoglobin in cold, low-oxygen environments.
