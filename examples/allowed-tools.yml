            You can run the following commands to help with development:
            - npm install: Install dependencies
            - npm run build: Build the project
            - npm run test:*: Run tests (you can specify test patterns)
            - npm run lint:*: Run linting tools
            - npm run typecheck: Check TypeScript types
            - git status/diff: Check git repository status
            
            Always explain what you're about to run and why before executing commands.
            If tests fail, analyze the output and suggest fixes.
